The project will focus on exploring US employment data provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics is primarily responsible for the activities, working conditions, and prices of the labor market in the US economic environment. Its main functions include the collection, analysis and dissemination of important information to support public and private decision-making.

In this project, we will use the 2018 annual census data on employment and wages. This data includes both annual employment and wage data for different regions and industries, which can be found via (official website of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics)[www.bls.gov] .

In this project, we will not only analyze from the perspective of state and country, but also start to analyze in depth from several industries. At the same time, we will also analyze the changes in wage distribution over time from 2008 to 2018, and the changes in the US employment situation reflected by these changes.
